# Animal Hunt

An NFC tag demo scavenger hunt game. Allows configuruing a set of NFC tags to represent animals, and then challenges the user to find the right animal tag and scan it.

Animals are stored on the tags as a URL, so that the tag can be scanned without opening the app first, so long as it is installed.
